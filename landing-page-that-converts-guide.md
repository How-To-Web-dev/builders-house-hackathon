# Basic things for all landing pages to improve conversions

## Understand what drives conversion

Do you know why they say that the money is in the follow-up? Because the difference between someone who doesn’t know about your product and a buyer is **FREQUENCY**.

Frequency drives conversion. Why are retargeting ads so powerful? Because what they really are is a frequency campaign. Constant exposure to *THE SAME ONE THING* again and again and again.


## High-converting lading pages follow three rules.

### Conversion rule #1: One big idea or message.

How you communicate your product is crucial. Communicating your product goes way beyond features and benefits. You need a big idea or message.

Sales pages with a conversion rate of 10%+ convey ONE (and only ONE) big idea. And they do it repeatedly—again and again and again and again and again and again.

Headlines refer to *the idea*, the body text talks about *the big idea*, the visuals depict *the idea*, the Q&A centers around *the idea*, the testimonials you include are the ones that mention *the big idea*, etc.

A big idea / big message is easy to remember and gets stuck more easily in our brain through repetition.

#### Which one is easier to remember?

*"Focusing without distraction on a cognitively demanding task for an extended period…"*

Or...

*"deep work.”*

### Conversion rule #2: No options, no distractions.

That means no pricing plans, no bar menu, no about us page, no links, no “join our email list,” etc. Only one page, where the only way of getting out is by clicking a CTA button that takes you to the sign-up or a demo call.

#### When it comes to your offer, there are numerous variables to consider:
- Free trial or no free trial?
- 7-day or 30-day trial?
- Pricing? Plans? Features?
- Credit card required or not required?
- etc.

Each option has its pros and cons.

For example, free trials without a credit card requirement tend to convert better, but they also attract less committed users (most of those people won’t even try your product).

You cannot know if one is definitively better than the other. You need to test different variables. What works for another company might not work for you, and vice versa.

#### Remember: Options kill conversion.

For example, forget about pricing plans. Create ONE compelling offer designed for customer acquisition.

### Conversion rule #3: Easy to read.

Headlines, headlines, headlines...

The rest of the copy doesn’t really matter. Convey your big idea through your headlines. Literally.

People should be able to understand your product solely by reading your headlines. The rest of the copy should sell your big idea again and again and again. People are lazy and will scan your page (via headlines) for 10 seconds, before deciding if they understand what your product is about. If they like it, they will keep reading.

So, don’t use typical, vague marketing headlines.

#### Headlines you don’t want:

*"Powered by AI"*

#### Headlines you want (specific):

***“Save 300 hours per month thanks to our customizable AI.”***

Easy to read. Easy to remember. Full frequency. No distractions.

Those are the building blocks of a great sales page.
